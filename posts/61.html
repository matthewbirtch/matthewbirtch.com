<p style="margin-top: 0px; width: 310px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;">I left this morning bright and early at 5:30 with the sunrising. I wasn't able to make a reservation on the Chi Chi Maun so I wanted to make sure I got there early enough to get on without a reservation. It's a good thing I left so early because when I arrived here in Tobermory they weren't letting anymore unreserved cars on the 11:20 ferry. Thankfully, the tollbooth guy let me on because I have a small car. Thanks buddy! Otherwise I would have had to wait for the 1:30 ferry - not what I wanted to do.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I took a walk around the town, but it's really just your typical harbour town. A nice marina and lots of gift shops. Maybe I'll get some treats at 'The Sweet Shop'. I'm sure Manitoulin Island is much more exciting, but I don't think I'll have much time to stop and explore there. It's a long way to Wawa still!</p>
